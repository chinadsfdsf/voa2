info2 : "The Story of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858  Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. In the summer of 1858, two candidates campaigned across the state of Illinois for a seat in the United States Senate. That seat belonged to Stephen Douglas from the Democratic Party. He was seeking re-election. His opponent was a lawyer from the newly established Republican Party. His name was Abraham Lincoln. This week in our series, Frank Oliver and Larry West tell us about this campaign of statewide but also national importance. Abraham Lincoln proposed that he and Stephen Douglas hold several debates. The rules for each debate would be the same. One man would speak for an hour. His opponent would speak for an hour and a half. Then the first man would speak for half an hour to close the debate. Douglas agreed. Douglas spoke first at the first debate. He questioned a statement made in one of Lincoln s campaign speeches. Lincoln had said that the United States could not continue to permit slavery in some areas, while banning it in others. He said the Union could not stand so divided. It must either permit slavery everywhere -- or nowhere. Douglas did not agree. He noted that the country had been half-slave and half-free for seventy years. Why then, he asked, should it not continue to exist that way. The United States was a big country. What was best for one part might not be best for another. Then Douglas questioned Lincoln s statement on the Supreme Court s Dred Scott decision. Lincoln had said he opposed the decision, because it did not permit Negroes to enjoy the rights of citizenship. Douglas said he believed the decision was correct. He said it was clear that the government had been made by white men, for white men. He said he opposed Negro citizenship.  I do not accept the Negro as my equal,  Douglas said.  And I deny that he is my brother. However,  he said,  this does not mean I believe that Negroes should be slaves. Negroes should enjoy every possible right that does not threaten the safety of the society in which they live.   Every state and territory must decide for itself what these rights will be. Illinois decided that Negroes will not be citizens, but that it will protect their life, property, and civil rights. It keeps from Negroes only political rights, and refuses to make Negroes equal to white men. That policy satisfies me,  Douglas said.  And, it satisfies the Democratic Party.  Then Lincoln spoke. First, he denied that the Republican Party was an Abolitionist party.  I have no purpose,  he said,  either directly or indirectly, to interfere with slavery where it exists. I believe I have no legal right to do so. Nor do I wish to do so. I do not,  Lincoln said,  wish to propose political and social equality between the white and black races.   But,  he went on,  there is no reason in the world why Negroes should not have all the natural rights listed in the Declaration of Independence. The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I agree with Judge Douglas,  Lincoln said,  that the Negro is not my equal in many ways -- certainly not in color, perhaps not mentally or morally. But in the right to eat the bread that his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.  Lincoln then defended his statement that the United States could not continue half slave and half free. Slavery could be left alone in the South until it slowly died. That way, Lincoln said, would be best for both the white and black races. Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln were campaigning for a Senate seat from the state of Illinois. But their debates had national importance, too. Lincoln also wanted to keep alive the debate over slavery.  That,  he said,  is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself are silent. It is the eternal struggle between right and wrong.  On election day, the legislative candidates supporting Lincoln won four thousand more popular votes than the candidates supporting Douglas. But because of the way election areas had been organized, the Douglas Democrats won a majority of seats. The newly elected legislature chose him to be senator. If anyone said anything about  Lincoln for president,  he would answer that he did not have the ability. Or he would say there were better men in the party than himself. Lincoln    Only events can make a president.  He would wait for those events. "

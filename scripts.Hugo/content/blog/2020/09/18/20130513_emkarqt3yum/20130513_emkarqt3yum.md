info2 : "Welcome to the MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. In 1848, while James Polk was president, there was a great constitutional debate in the United States. It arose over slavery in the new territories. Southerners argued that they had the right to take slaves into New Mexico and California. Northerners opposed any further spread of slavery. The question was   did Congress have the power to control or even ban slavery in the new territories? Senator John Clayton of Delaware proposed to the Senate that it name a special committee on the question of slavery in the new territories. Both parties -- the Whigs and the Democrats -- had the same number of senators on the committee. Senator Clayton was its chairman. South and North were equally represented. After six days, Clayton s committee agreed on a compromise bill. It proposed that Oregon be organized as free territory. Slavery there would be illegal. And on California and New Mexico, the bill proposed   they could be organized as territories. But their territorial legislatures would not have the power to act on the issue of slavery. All questions on slavery in these two territories must be decided by the United States Supreme Court. After long debate, Congress finally approved territorial government for Oregon. And it voted that Oregon should be free territory, with slavery illegal. The vote on the Oregon bill was very close. It passed in the Senate only because 2 men from slave states voted for it. They were Senator Thomas Benton of Missouri and Senator Sam Houston of Texas. Senator John C. Calhoun said it was a bad defeat for the South. But what was worse was the fact that it was caused by the votes of 2 southern senators. Polk, however, had not served his party well. He was not a good politician. He failed to unite the disputing groups of the Democratic Party. What was worse, he let them move even farther apart. There seemed to be no strong Democratic candidate who could unite the party. At one extreme were the supporters of former President Van Buren -- New York Democrats opposed to slavery. They were called  Barnburners.  They got this name from their political opponents, who charged that they were willing to burn down the barn to get rid of pro-slavery rats. At the party s other extreme were the Democrats of the South, led by John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. In every state, the Democrats were divided between those who supported the administration and those opposed to it. The Democrats met in Baltimore in May 1848 to choose their presidential candidate. Several men were proposed as possi  Polk s Treasury Secretary Robert Walker of Mississippi; John Dix of New York; and Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan. On the 4th, the convention chose Cass as the party s presidential candidate. Cass was 66 years old. He was a middle-of-the-road Democrat. He was a northerner who did not oppose slavery. On the question of slavery in the new territories, Cass believed that the people of the territory should make the decision. The Barnburner Democrats of New York refused to accept Cass as their candidate. They walked out of the Baltimore convention. Some Whig leaders remembered how William Henry Harrison had won the presidency for the party by campaigning as a military hero. The country had a new military hero now.  Old Zach  -- General Zachary Taylor. General Taylor and his men never lost a battle in the Mexican War. Several times, he defeated Mexican forces much larger than his. After the general s first victory, New York political leader Thurlow Weed happened to meet Taylor s brother on a Hudson River steamboat. That meeting had a most important effect on future events. Weed asked Joseph Taylor if his brother was a political man. Joseph answered that  Old Zach  was not. He said his brother belonged to no party, that often he did not even vote. He said Zach supported Henry Clay and did not like Andrew Jackson. Joseph said his brother felt strongly that American products should be protected against competition from foreign imports. He felt so strongly about it, Joseph said, that he refused to wear any imported clothing. Weed made a quick decision.  Your brother,  he said,  will be our next president.  By July of 1847, Old Zach had made up his mind. He told a    I am satisfied that if the election were held now, nothing could prevent me from becoming president.  Senator Clay did not think Taylor had the ability to be president. But Clay knew well how the voters loved a military hero. Senator Clay was 70 years old. He knew this would be his last chance to become president. He worked very hard to get the support of Whig leaders. The Whig Party held its convention in Philadelphia in June of 1848. Four names were put before the co  General Zachary Taylor, Henry Clay, General Winfield Scott and Daniel Webster. That will be our story next week. "

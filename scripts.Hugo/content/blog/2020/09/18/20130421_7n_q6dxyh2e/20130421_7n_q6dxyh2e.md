info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. In the spring of 1820, President James Monroe was coming to the end of his first four years as president. He wanted to be elected again. But he faced a difficult decision. Congress, after much debate between the North and the South, had approved a bill giving statehood to Missouri. Missouri was part of the Louisiana territory. Southern lawmakers wanted Missouri to permit slavery. Northerners wanted no slaves in Missouri. A compromise was reached. Missouri could have slaves. But nowhere else in the northern part of the Louisiana territory would slavery be permitted. Monroe believed the compromise was wrong--  but not because it kept slaves out of the territory. The president did not believe the Constitution gave Congress the right to make such conditions. So Monroe signed the bill.  The crisis seemed ended. But a few months later, a new problem developed. Missouri wrote a state constitution that it sent to Congress for approval. One part of this constitution did not permit free black men to enter the state. The constitution was immediately opposed by a number of congressmen. They charged that it violated the United States constitution. The United States Constitution said citizens of each state had the rights of citizens of each of the other states. And since free black men were citizens of some states, they should have the right to be citizens of Missouri. The debate over this lasted several months. The compromise of 1820 settled the crisis of slavery for more than twenty years. But everyone knew that the settlement was only temporary. Monroe s first four years as president had been successful. He had increased the size of the United States. Florida now was part of the country. And the problem of slavery had been temporarily settled. There had been economic problems--  some of the worst in the nation s history. But the situation was getting better. The separate interests of these different sections produced an exciting presidential election campaign in 1824. Each section had at least one candidate. Several had more than one. The campaign began almost as soon as Monroe was elected for the second time. At one time, as many as 16 men thought of themselves as presidential possibilities. By 1822, the number had been reduced to six men. Three of them were members of Monroe s cabinet: Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, Treasury Secretary William Crawford, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun. Adams was the only northern candidate. He was an extremely able man. There were few jobs in government he could not do, and do well. But he was not the kind of man that people liked. He was cold, questioning, and had a sharp tongue. His father was John Adams, the second president of the United States. The West had two candidates in the election of 1824. One was Henry Clay of Kentucky--   Harry of the West --  a great lawyer, congressman, speaker of the House and senator. The other was Andrew Jackson--   Old Hickory --  the hero of New Orleans [the Battle of New Orleans during the war of 1812]. Jackson was poorly educated, knew little about government, and had a terrible temper. He was a fighter, a man of the people. The sixth candidate was Dewitt Clinton of New York. He was governor of that state and leader of the commission that built the Erie Canal. But New York presidential electors were chosen by the legislature, which was controlled by Clinton s enemies. So Clinton s chances were poor. Treasury Secretary Crawford was clearly the leading candidate two years before the election. But he had a serious illness in the autumn of 1823. He could not meet with the cabinet for months. He could not sign official papers. Crawford did go back to work. But he was only a shadow of the man he had been.  He walks slowly, like a blind man,  wrote one reporter. So that took secretary Crawford out as a possible candidate for the coming election. Our program was written by Frank Beardsley. The narrators were Steve Ember and Sarah Long. To learn more about American history, go to voaspecialenglish.com. We have transcripts, MP3s and podcasts of our programs as well as historical images.

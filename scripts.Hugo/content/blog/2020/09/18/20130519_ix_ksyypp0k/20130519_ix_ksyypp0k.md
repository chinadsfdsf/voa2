info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. In 1850, President Zachary Taylor died after serving about a year and a half in office. Taylor s vice president, Millard Fillmore, took his place. Early in his administration, President Fillmore signed the Compromise of Eighteen Fifty. That compromise helped settle a dispute over slavery and the western territories. It ended a crisis between northern and southern states. It prevented a civil war. In 1852, an American woman published a book about slavery. She called it  Uncle Tom s Cabin.  The woman, Harriet Beecher Stowe, wrote the book for one reason. She wanted to show how cruel slavery was. Stowe s words painted a picture of slavery that most people in the North had never seen. They were shocked. In many places, it seemed impossible that negroes and whites could live together peacefully, in freedom. The best answer, many people thought, was to free the slaves and help them return to Africa. It was not a new idea. Forty years earlier, a group of leading Americans had formed an organization for that purpose. They called it the American Colonization Society. In 1820, the Society began helping send negroes to Africa. The negroes formed a government of their own. In 1847, they declared themselves independent. They called their new country the Republic of Liberia. The new country had a constitution like that of the United States. By 1854, nine thousand negroes from the United States had been sent to Liberia. Some had technical skills. They knew how to make iron. They knew how to use steam engines and other machinery. The Colonization Society hoped these negroes would use their skills to help improve life for the people of Africa. The Society s plan ended a cruel life of slavery for many negroes. Negro slaves took great chances to escape to freedom. Many gained their freedom through the so-called  underground railroad.  That was not a real railroad. It was an organization of people who secretly helped slaves escape to the North. The Democrats opened their presidential nominating convention in Baltimore on the first of June, 1852. The delegates agreed that a man must win two-thirds of the convention s votes to be the party s candidate. On the first ballot, no one got two-thirds of the vote. So the voting continued. Finally, on the forty-seventh ballot, support began to increase for one of the minor candidates. His name was Franklin Pierce. Pierce was from the northeastern state of New Hampshire. He had served as a congressman and senator. On the forty-ninth ballot, Pierce won. He would be the Democratic Party s candidate for president. The Whig party held its presidential nominating convention in Baltimore two weeks after the Democrats. Three Whigs wanted to be nominated: President Millard Fillmore, Secretary of State Daniel Webster and General Winfield Scott. The same thing that happened at the Democratic convention now happened at the Whig convention. Delegates voted over and over again. But no man got enough votes to win. It took fifty-three ballots before one of the men -- General Scott -- won the nomination. The presidential campaign lasted about five months. The election was in November. Pierce, the Democrat, won a crushing victory over Scott, the Whig. The new president, Franklin Pierce, was a charming man. He made friends easily. Those who knew Pierce best worried about this. They knew that under all his friendly charm, he was a weak man. They feared that the duties and problems of the presidency would be too great for him to deal with. As president in 1853, Pierce was forced to choose between two policies on the issue of slavery. He could support the Compromise of Eighteen Fifty and declare it to be the final settlement of the problem. That would lead to a fight with northern and southern extremists. Or he could compromise with the extremists and give them jobs in his administration. That would be the easy way to satisfy their demands. And that was the policy Pierce chose. In putting together his cabinet, President Pierce tried to include men from every group in the Democratic Party. He named William Marcy of New York to be secretary of state. Marcy opposed the spread of slavery and all talk of splitting the Union. Jefferson Davis of Mississippi was named secretary of war. Davis, more than any other man, represented the southern extremists. He had threatened to take the South out of the Union if any limits were put on slavery. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts was named attorney general. Although a northerner, Cushing was a friend of many southern extremists. He was a very able man, but his loyalties were not clear. James Buchanan of Pennsylvania was named Minister to Britain. All of these men had strong ideas about the future of the United States. President Pierce found it difficult to control them. thank to manythings.org for audio and text This is a VOA product and is in the public domain "

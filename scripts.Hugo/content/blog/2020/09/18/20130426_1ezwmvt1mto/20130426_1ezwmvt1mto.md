info2 : "Debating the Powerful Bank of the US   Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English.  The question of continuing the Bank of the United States became a serious political issue in the national election of 1832. The head of the bank, Nicholas Biddle, had become very powerful. Biddle refused to recognize that the government had the right to interfere in any way with the bank s business. The bank was privately operated but could make loans with taxpayers  money.  Jackson said the Bank of the United States was dangerous to the liberty of Americans. He proposed to form a new national bank, as part of the Treasury Department.  In the election year of 1832, the bank still had four years left to continue. Many of Jackson s advisers believed he should say nothing about the bank until after the election. They feared he might lose the votes of some supporters of the bank. Biddle felt that this might be the best time to get a charter.  The campaign for a new charter was led by the most powerful men in each house of Congress. In the Senate, the bank s supporters included Senator Clay and Daniel Webster. Former President John Quincy Adams -- now a congressman -- led the bank s struggle in the house.  The chief opponent to the bank was Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri.  I object to the renewal of the charter,  he told the Senate,  because the bank is too great and powerful to be permitted in a government of free and equal laws. I also object because the bank makes the rich richer, and the poor poorer.   In the House, Representative Augustin Clayton of Georgia proposed an investigation of the bank. In a speech written by Senator Benton, Clayton charged that the bank had violated its charter a number of times.  The investigation was approved. Four members of the seven-man committee were opponents of the bank. Three, including John Quincy Adams, were friendly. As expected, opponents of the bank found the charges to be true. And the bank s supporters found them all to be false.  Attorney General Roger Taney told of one example of this. Taney opposed the bank.  The Senate finally voted on the bank s new charter. The vote was twenty-eight for and twenty against. The House voted three weeks later. It approved the charter, one hundred seven to eighty-five.  The bill was sent to the White House. President Jackson called a cabinet meeting. Two cabinet members, McLane and Livingston, agreed that the bill should be vetoed. But they urged Jackson to reject the bank charter in such a way that a compromise might be worked out later.  Attorney General Taney, however, believed that the veto should be in the strongest possible language. He opposed any compromise that would continue the bank beyond 1836. Jackson agreed with Taney.  On July tenth, the veto was announced. And the message explaining it was sent to Congress. Jackson said he did not believe the bank s charter was constitutional. He said it was true that the Supreme Court had ruled that Congress had the right to charter a national bank. But he said he did not agree with the high court.  And Jackson said the president -- in taking his oath of office -- swears to support the Constitution as he understands it, not as it is understood by others. He said the president and the Congress had the same duty as the court to decide if a bill was constitutional.   It is to be regretted,  he said,  that the rich and powerful bend the acts of the government to their own purposes. Differences among men will always exist under every just government.  Equality of ability, or education, or of wealth cannot be produced by human institutions. Every man has the equal right of protection under the laws. But when these laws are used to make the rich richer, and the powerful more powerful, then the more humble members of our society have a right to complain of injustice.   Jackson said he could not understand how the present owners of the bank could have any claim of special treatment from the government. He said the government should shower its favors -- as heaven does its rain -- on the high and low alike, on the rich and the poor equally.  After his first two years as president, Andrew Jackson was not sure he wished to serve a second term. Jackson was not sure his health would permit him to complete a full eight years in the White House. But he wished to be a candidate again in 1832 to give the people a chance to show they approved of his programs.  Jackson decided that he would campaign again for president. But if he won, he would resign after the first or second year, and leave the job to his vice president. "

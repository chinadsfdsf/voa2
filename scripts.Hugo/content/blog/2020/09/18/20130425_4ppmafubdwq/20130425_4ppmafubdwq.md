info2 : "Bank of the United States Worries Jackson  Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. President Jackson s cabinet was in great disorder. Vice President Calhoun was trying to force out Secretary of War John Eaton. Eaton would not resign, and the president would not dismiss him. Van Buren designed a plan to gain Eaton s resignation. One morning, as Jackson discussed his cabinet problems, Van Buren said:  There is only one thing, general, that will bring you peace -- my resignation.   Never,  said Jackson. Van Buren explained how his resignation would solve a number of Jackson s political problems. Jackson did not want to let Van Buren go. But the next day, he told Van Buren that he would never stop any man who wished to leave. Eaton said:  Gentlemen, this is all wrong. I am the one who should resign!  Van Buren said Eaton must be sure of such a move. Eaton was sure. President Jackson accepted Eaton s decision as he had accepted Van Buren s. But he was unwilling to give up completely the services of his two friends. He named Van Buren to be minister to Britain. And he told Eaton that he would help him get elected again to the Senate. Jackson then dismissed the remaining members of his cabinet. He was free to organize a new cabinet that would be loyal to him and not to Vice President Calhoun. Even with a new cabinet, Jackson still faced the problem of nullification. South Carolina politicians, led by Calhoun, continued to claim that states had the right to reject -- nullify -- a federal law which they believed was bad. They declared that the federal import tax laws of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional, and therefore, cancelled. They said citizens of South Carolina need not pay the tax. The nullifiers also declared that if the federal government tried to use force against South Carolina, then the state would withdraw from the union and form its own independent government. President Jackson answered with a declaration of his own. Jackson said America s constitution formed a government, not just an association of sovereign states. South Carolina had no right to cancel a federal law or to withdraw from the union. Disunion by force was treason. Jackson said:  The laws of the United States must be enforced. This is my duty under the Constitution. I have no other choice.  While preparing to use force, Jackson offered hope for a peaceful settlement. In his yearly message to Congress, he spoke of reducing the federal import tax which hurt the sale of southern cotton overseas. He said the import tax could be reduced, because the national debt would soon be paid. Congress passed a compromise bill to end the import tax by 1842. South Carolina s congressmen accepted the compromise. They did not, however, give up their belief in the idea of nullification. The idea continued to be a threat to the American union until the issue was settled in the Civil War which began in 1861. While President Jackson battled the nullifiers, another struggle began. This time, it was Jackson against the Bank of the United States. Congress provided money to establish the Bank of the United States in 1816. It gave the bank a charter to do business for 20 years. The bank was permitted to use the government s money to make loans. For this, the bank paid the government one and one-half million dollars a year. The bank was run by private citizens. During Jackson s presidency, the Bank of the United States was headed by Nicholas Biddle. Biddle was an extremely intelligent man. He had completed studies at the University of Pennsylvania when he was only thirteen years old. When he was 18, he was sent to Paris as secretary to the American minister. Jackson criticized the bank in each of his yearly messages to Congress. He said the Bank of the United States was dangerous to the liberty of the people. He said the bank could build up or pull down political parties through loans to politicians. Jackson opposed giving the bank a new charter. He proposed that a new bank be formed as part of the Treasury Department. Many of President Jackson s advisers believed he should say nothing about the bank until after the presidential election of 1832. They feared he might lose the votes of those who supported the bank. Jackson accepted their advice. He agreed not to act on the issue, if bank president Biddle would not request renewal of the charter before the election. Biddle agreed. Then he changed his mind. He asked Congress for a new charter in January 1832. The request became a hot political issue in the presidential campaign. "

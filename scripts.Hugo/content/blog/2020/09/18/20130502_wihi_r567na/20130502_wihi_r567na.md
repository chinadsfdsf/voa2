info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English.  The fourth of March, 1837, was a bright, beautiful day. The sun warmed the thousands who watched the power of government pass from one man to another.  Andrew Jackson left the White House with the man who would take his place, Martin Van Buren. They sat next to each other as the presidential carriage moved down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol building.  Cheers stopped in the throats of the thousands who stood along the street. In silence, they removed their hats to show how much they loved this old man who was stepping down.   For once,  wrote Senator Thomas Hart Benton,  the rising sun was eclipsed by the setting sun.   The big crowd on the east side of the Capitol grew quiet when Jackson and Van Buren walked out onto the front steps of the building. After Chief Justice Taney swore in President Van Buren, the new president gave his inaugural speech.  Then Andrew Jackson started slowly down the steps. A mighty cheer burst from the crowd.   It was a cry,  wrote Senator Benton,  such as power never commanded, nor man in power received. It was love, gratitude and admiration. I felt a feeling that had never passed through me before.   Another senator put it this    He called himself  the people s friend.  And he gave proofs of his sincerity. General Jackson understood the people of the United States better, perhaps, than any president before him.   Jackson was always willing to let the people judge his actions. He was ready to risk his political life for what he believed in. Jackson s opposition could not understand why the people did not destroy him. They said he was lucky.  Jackson s luck  the opposition called it.  Jackson seemed always to win whatever struggle he began. And the men he fought against were not weak opponents. They were political   Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Nicholas Biddle. The old general fought these men separately and, at times, all together.  The day after Van Buren became president, Jackson met with a few of his friends. Frank Blair, the editor of Jackson s newspaper, was one of them. Senator Benton was another. It was a warm, friendly meeting. They thought back over Jackson s years in the White House and talked about what had been done.  Jackson said he thought his best piece of work was getting rid of the Bank of the United States. He said he had saved the people from a monopoly of a few rich men.  Someone asked about Texas. Jackson said he was not worried about Texas. That problem would solve itself, he said.  Did the general have any regrets about anything?  Only two,  said Jackson.  I regret I was unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun.   The next morning, March sixth, Jackson left Washington to return to his home in Tennessee. President Van Buren protested that Jackson was not well enough to travel.  The old man had been sick for the last few months of his presidency. He suffered from tuberculosis, and at times lost great amounts of blood from his lungs.  When Jackson refused to listen to Van Buren s protests, the president sent the army s top doctor, Surgeon General Thomas Lawson, to travel with Jackson.  General Jackson was to leave the capital by train. Thousands of people lined the streets to the train station, waiting for a last look at their president. Jackson stood in the open air on the rear platform of the train. His hat was off, and the wind blew through his long white hair.  Not a sound came from the people who crowded around the back of the train. A bell rang. There was a hiss of steam. And the train began to move. General Jackson bowed. The crowd stood still.  The train moved around a curve and could no longer be seen. The crowd began to break up. One man who was there said it was as if a bright star had gone out of the sky.  Jackson lived for eight more years. He died as he had lived, with dignity and honor.  A few hours after his death, a tall man and a small child arrived at the Jackson home. They had traveled a long way -- all the way from Texas. The big man was Sam Houston, the president of Texas. He had heard that his friend was dying.  Houston was too late to say goodbye. He stood before Jackson s body, tears in his eyes. Then Houston dropped to his knees and buried his face on the chest of his friend and chief. He pulled the small boy close to him.   My son,  he said,  try to remember that you have looked on the face of Andrew Jackson.   Andrew Jackson stepped down from the presidency in March, 1837. His presidential powers were passed to his most trusted political assistant, Martin Van Buren of New York. "
